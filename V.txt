What is the policy for late assignment submissions in this class?

> For homework, you will have an automatic grace day by which you can turn the
assignment in late, without penalty. After that, late assignments will incur a 1% point reduction for
each hour that it is late, as late assignments are not worthless, but worth less. Again, this is to mimic
industry conditions. Time is of the essence.
